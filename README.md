# Cub3D

Second graphical projet of the common-core. We needed, in teams of two, to create a Doom / Wolfenstein 3D kind of game, that uses the concept of Raycasting to create it's 3D effect.

There was a set of rules we needed to follow, such as displaying a different texture for the walls, depending on which direction they were facing, ceiling and floor can have different colors, you needed to be able to move through your map with W A S D, etc.

Just like So-Long, the map also had it's own restrictions. They needed to be closed by walls and have no space not enclosed inside the map, must be a .cub file, cannot have more than one starting point and it must show the direction we'll face when the game start, etc.

We did some bonuses, such as collisions with walls (don't know why it wasn't mandatory), sounds for when those collisions happens, a minimap and rotating the view with the mouse.
